Bolt: A bolt is a type of threaded fastener with a cylindrical body and a head, which is used to secure parts together. Bolts typically require a nut to fasten the connection. The bolt’s threads allow it to be screwed into a matching threaded hole or nut to create a strong connection.
Nut: A nut is a small, hexagonal (or other shaped) metal piece with an internal thread that pairs with a bolt’s external thread. It tightens or secures the bolt into place, creating a strong, reliable connection.
