<h2>Wire Harness Processing Equipment Market Overview:</h2>
<p><p>According to Market Strides the Global Night Light Market Size will approximately grow at a <strong>CAGR of 4.4%</strong> during the forecast period.</p>  
<p>In recent years, the market has grown a lot. This is due to things like more people wanting options for ambient lighting, more people learning about how important sleep hygiene is, and improvements in lighting technology. One of the main reasons the market is growing is that more people are becoming aware of how light affects how well you sleep. Research has shown that being exposed to bright or blue-rich light right before bed can mess up the way your body normally sleeps. Because of this, many people are turning to night lights that give off warm, dim light to help them sleep.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many different kinds of night lights, such as ones that plug in, ones that run on batteries, ones that can be charged with a USB cable, and ones that can be carried around. Each type is made for different users' needs and tastes. Night lights can also come in different styles, like wall-mounted lights, table lamps, and artistic lights, so people can choose ones that match their room's design. With the rise of ""smart home"" technologies, night lights now have features that let them link to the internet. Smart night lights can be controlled from afar using smartphone apps or voice helpers. This lets users change settings like brightness, color, and when the light turns on and off. These smart features make things easier for users and give them more ways to customize them, which increases the demand for these kinds of goods.</p></p>
